Description: ======================================================
        pySkewT -- Atmospheric Profile Plotting and Diagnostics
        ======================================================
        
        pySkewT provides a few useful tools to help with the plotting and analysis of 
        upper atmosphere data. In particular it provides some useful classes to 
        handle the awkward skew-x projection.
        
        This package is based in the SkewT python package developed by Thomas Chubb
        (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SkewT/)
        
        The main difference with the orginal SkewT package is that the vertical soundings 
        plots are handled by an special class (SkewT) derived from the matplotlib Figure
        class. 
        
        The new SkewT class extends the base Figure class with an iterface similar to pyplot
        and also allows to create the Skew-T plots.
        This new class allows a complete control over the Figure properties like
        multiple plots (normal axis and Skew-T axis).
