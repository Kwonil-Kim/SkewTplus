Description: =========================================================
SkewTplus -- Atmospheric Profile Plotting and Diagnostics
=========================================================

SkewTplus provides a few useful tools to help with the plotting and analysis of 
upper atmosphere data. In particular, it provides some useful classes to 
handle the awkward skew-x projection.
        
This package is based on the SkewT Python package developed by Thomas Chubb
(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SkewT/)
        
The main difference with the original *SkewT package* is that the vertical soundings 
plots are handled by a special class (SkewT).
The new *SkewT* class extends the base
`matplolib's Figure <http://matplotlib.org/api/figure_api.html?highlight=figure#module-matplotlib.figure>`_
class with an interface similar to 
`matplolib's pyplot <http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html>`_.
It also allows to create Skew-T type plots in a simple way.
This new class allows a complete control over the Figure properties like
multiple plots (normal axis and Skew-T axis).

In addition, the **thermodynamics** module was improved.
All the intensive computations were migrated to Cython and paralellized.
   
The SkewT Python package was a cornerstone of this project.  
We are grateful to all its collaborators.
